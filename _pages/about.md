I am currently a Research Associate under Prof. Cecilia Mascolo(<https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/>) at the Mobile System Research Laboratory(<https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html>) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. My current research interests are in Mobility analysis, Federated Learning, and Statistical Privacy.

I did my PhD from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh under [Dr. Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing" [[Thesis](files/Thesis_Abhirup.pdf)]. I was a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr. Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/). My research interest is to design analysis and privacy-preserving algorithms using tools from topology, geometry, and statistics to infer abstract knowledge from massive and noisy sensing data.
